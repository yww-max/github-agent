# GitHub Agent

A powerful GitHub automation agent built with Model Context Protocol (MCP) for enhanced repository management and automation.

## What is Model Context Protocol (MCP)?

Model Context Protocol (MCP) is a standardized protocol that enables AI models to interact with external systems and tools in a structured, secure, and efficient manner. It provides a common interface for AI agents to access various services and perform complex operations.

## Key Features

- **Repository Management**: Create, update, and manage GitHub repositories
- **Issue Tracking**: Handle issues, pull requests, and project management
- **Code Analysis**: Analyze codebases and provide insights
- **Automation**: Automate common GitHub workflows and tasks
- **Integration**: Seamlessly integrate with other tools and services

## MCP Capabilities

This GitHub agent leverages MCP to provide the following capabilities:

### Repository Operations
- Create and configure new repositories
- Clone and manage existing repositories
- Update repository settings and metadata
- Manage branches, tags, and releases

### Issue and Pull Request Management
- Create, update, and close issues
- Manage pull requests and code reviews
- Track project progress and milestones
- Handle notifications and assignments

### Code Management
- Search and analyze code across repositories
- Manage file contents and structure
- Handle commits and version control
- Perform code reviews and quality checks

### Collaboration Features
- Manage team members and permissions
- Handle organization-level operations
- Coordinate with external contributors
- Track project metrics and analytics

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- GitHub account with appropriate permissions
- MCP-compatible environment
- Node.js or Python runtime (depending on implementation)

### Installation
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/github-agent.git
cd github-agent

# Install dependencies
npm install  # or pip install -r requirements.txt

# Configure authentication
export GITHUB_TOKEN=your_github_token
```

### Basic Usage
```javascript
// Example: Create a new repository
const agent = new GitHubAgent();
await agent.createRepository({
  name: 'my-new-project',
  description: 'A new project created with GitHub Agent',
  private: false
});
```

## Architecture

The GitHub Agent is built on the MCP framework, which provides:

- **Standardized Interface**: Consistent API across different tools and services
- **Security**: Secure authentication and authorization mechanisms
- **Extensibility**: Easy integration with new tools and capabilities
- **Reliability**: Robust error handling and retry mechanisms
